Static Boilerplate is a frontend template I just mashed up based on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com), [Travis Neilson's DevTips StarterKit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit) packed with [Zell Liew's Gulp](http://zellwk.com/blog/gulp-tutorial/) goodness.

This is just something that currently fits in my current workflow & process when I want to build a really simple static site. So feel free to fork or improve this repo by shooting a pull request! :)

Source: [Static Boilerplate](https://github.com/r4in/static-boilerplate)

## Quick start

How To Use:

1.  Clone the git repo â€” `git clone https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git`

2.  Install all node dependencies with `npm install --save-dev`. I'm using Gulp as my primary task runner for autotomating stuff around.

3.  All source files are the the app folder. This will be your workspace and to begin, open the terminal and `gulp watch` to activate sass & livereload.

4.  To prepare your code for deployment, run `gulp build` to export everything to the dist folder.

## Features

* Jam packed with [`HTML5`](https://html5boilerplate.com/) goodness.
* [`Bootstrap 4.css`](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  Latest bootstrap framework
* [`Reboot`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_reboot.scss)
  An continous switch from css reset to normalize to reboot
* [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) via CDN, with a local fallback

## Browser support

* Chrome _(latest 2)_
* Edge _(latest 2)_
* Firefox _(latest 2)_
* Internet Explorer 8+
* Opera _(latest 2)_
* Safari _(latest 2)_

_This doesn't mean that HTML5 Boilerplate cannot be used in older browsers, just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above._
